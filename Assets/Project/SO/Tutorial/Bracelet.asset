  - "On your left wrist is the Master\u2019s Console. To open it, just take a look
    at your wrist\u2026 yes, right where you'd normally check the time. "

    one for the store, another for your task list, and a green one to start and end
    your workday. "
  - "Oh, and if you\u2019d rather have it on your other hand, there\u2019s a switch
    for that too! Complicated? Hang tight; it only gets more fun from here."
