  - "Oh, and don\u2019t forget to screw the bolts back on, unless you want the client
    questioning your skills!"
  - "Finally, it\u2019s time for some color!"
  - "See that hologram of the painted prosthetic? You can rotate it, look at it from
    all angles - that\u2019s what the client wants."
  - "When you\u2019re ready, grab the paint sprayer, select your color in the capsule
    machine (it is on your left), and go for it!"
  - "If it lights up green, congrats, you\u2019ve mastered colors! If it\u2019s red\u2026
    well, guess we\u2019ll give it another shot."
